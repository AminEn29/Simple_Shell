## Introduction
Simple Shell is a small Unix shell that is capable of running basic Unix commands such as cd, pwd, and ls. The main purpose of this project is to help students understand how Unix shells work by implementing a basic version of a Unix shell in C.

Our shell is capable of doing All basics command like the BASH shell like cd and pwd and ls.

We express our gratitude to ALX for providing us with the opportunity to contribute to this project, allowing us to rigorously test and enhance our technical capabilities.
